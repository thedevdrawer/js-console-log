Make your errors or warnings easier to read, make your data cleaner and more concise, and finally organize your code more efficiently with these console.log tweaks.

We go over different console.log display types, how to group your data, how to create tables and so much more. We even show you a way to get rid of console.log altogether with the built-in debugger command.
